### Introduction

The training "AI in Practice" will give you, at a basic level, knowledge about how to train a pre-trained model, the pre-requisites, what techniques that are used and how to continue experimenting in the finetuning of the model.

In this training we are going to use image classification, open data-set, a pre-trained model and Colab* to train your model.

A pre-trained model gives you the possibility to finetune an existing model trained on a large amount of data to better fit your purposes and by that also save you time. We will go through the more of the advantages later in the training.

There are many pre-trained models available for different purposes you can find some of them here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html

### The objective

The objective of this training is to give you enough knowledge to feel confident when entering an AI project. By understanding the steps requerired to train a model you will an advantage when working in AI related project. This by giving you both an theoretical knowledge but also by you being able to practice hands on - how to train a model.

### Learning objectives

After the training you will be able to:

    Describe the necessary steps to train a model
    Use a Jupyter Notebook - Google Colab
    Be able to train a model
        Prepare datasets
        Finetune pre-trained models
        Visualize and quantify results

### Pre-requisites

To be able to get the most out of this training we expect you to be aware of:

    The subject of AI
    The importance of data

### Training instructions

The training is primarly performed individially but you will be placed in a group.

There will be some group questions and exercises but you are expected to performe the tasks your-self.

There is a Common Terminology section in the end of your Colab document. The concepts or wording available in the Common Terminology section will be marked with an (*)  

There are also some links in the document if you want to learn more in the different sections

Let us know if you have any questions or your group members â€“ but first google it! "Googling " is one of the most common ways that data scientists work with understanding new techniques and ways of working.

### Duration

    Expected time to finish the training is in total 3 hours.

### The challenge

    The challenge in this training, is to finetune the pre-trained model to the use case and dataset - capable of image classification, see below for explanation. We will also later on in this training go through more on the benefits of working with a pre-trained model.
    In this case you will work with improving/training the model using a data set containing different images including scenes.
    The outcome of your work will result in a model that can classify "nature scenes" with a higher accuracy.

### Image classification

So why did we choose image classification for this training?

    Image classification is a technique that is used to classify or predict the class of a specific object in an image. Image classification is one of the most important applications of computer vision. The main goal of this technique is to accurately identify the features in an image. Its applications range from classifying objects in self-driving cars to identifying blood cells in the healthcare industry, from identifying defective items in the manufacturing industry to build a system that can classify persons wearing masks or not.

    Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.
